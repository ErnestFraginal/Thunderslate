          <h2>Under Construction</h2>
          <p>Good day! My name is Ernest James Fraginal. Currently, my website is under construction as I am going through a thorough retooling of my skillset and relearning all<br/>
          the things that I have forgotten. Tune in as I build my personal site slowly but surely as I improve my skills.</p>
          
        
            <h2>Personal Projects.</h2>
            <p>While I am still an amateur at coding, I am also an aspiring artist and have my own projects that I am working on the side! Have a look at some!</p>
